Physics Model
=============

We solve a 2D/2.5D incompressible reduced MHD tearing-mode setup in a periodic
box using a pseudo-spectral method and diffusive dissipation. Classic tearing
mode theory references include the FKR and Coppi regimes, and plasmoid
instability work builds on Sweet–Parker sheet scalings and subsequent linear
instability analyses.

Key references are listed in :doc:`references`.
